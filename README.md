# Routing and Deploying a Symfony Project

This repo contains the class exercise we did on day 8 of the [Programming in PHP](https://github.com/laurielim/REACT21K_PHP) course which is part of the Full Stack Web Development Program at [Business College Helsinki](https://en.bc.fi/qualifications/full-stack-web-developer-program/). It was deployed on Heroku. An SQL database was also enabled with CRUD commands implemented. The local db runs on SQLite and the hosted version used Heroku Postgres. Unfortunately, Heroku has removed the free plan of Heroku Postgres so I have taken down the instance.

I have also repurposed this Symfony App to manage the back-end of a [To Do application](https://github.com/laurielim/REACT21K_REACT_JS_TODO_APP) I was tasked to do for the React and Redux advanced course of the program and subsequent projects.
