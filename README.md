# Routing and Deploying a Symfony Project

This repo contains the class exercise we did on day 8 of the [Programming in PHP](https://github.com/laurielim/REACT21K_PHP) course which is part of the Full Stack Web Development Program at [Business College Helsinki](https://en.bc.fi/qualifications/full-stack-web-developer-program/). It's deployed on Heroku and you can access the [home route](//lit-bastion-54851.herokuapp.com/home) and the [recipes route](//lit-bastion-54851.herokuapp.com/recipes/all).

An SQL database was also enabled with CRUD commands implemented. The local db is running on SQLite and the hosted version uses Heroku Postrgres.

I have also repurposed this Symfony App to manage the back-end of a [To Do application](https://github.com/laurielim/REACT21K_REACT_JS_TODO_APP) I was tasked to do for the React and Redux advanced course of the program and subsequent projects.
